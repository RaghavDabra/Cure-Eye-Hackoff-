Low resource areas lack preventive and screening services, which causes millions of deaths per year. Our mission is to detect chronic diseases through non-invasive retinal scans. We trained a convolutional neural network in order to determine if someone has a chance of having Diabetic Retinopathy. We used the Messidor dataset to train our model.By using his dataset, we are able to determine if a person has the possibility of having Diabetic Retinopathy with an accuracy of 78%.
